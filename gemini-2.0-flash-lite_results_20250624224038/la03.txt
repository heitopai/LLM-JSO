user: You are given 10 jobs and 5 machines. Each job consists of 5 operations that must be processed in a predefined sequence on designated machines with given processing times:
Job 0 follows the machine sequence 1 → 2 → 0 → 4 → 3 with processing times 23, 45, 82, 84, 38.
Job 1 follows the machine sequence 2 → 1 → 0 → 4 → 3 with processing times 21, 29, 18, 41, 50.
Job 2 follows the machine sequence 2 → 3 → 4 → 0 → 1 with processing times 38, 54, 16, 52, 52.
Job 3 follows the machine sequence 4 → 0 → 2 → 1 → 3 with processing times 37, 54, 74, 62, 57.
Job 4 follows the machine sequence 4 → 0 → 1 → 3 → 2 with processing times 57, 81, 61, 68, 30.
Job 5 follows the machine sequence 4 → 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 with processing times 81, 79, 89, 89, 11.
Job 6 follows the machine sequence 3 → 2 → 0 → 4 → 1 with processing times 33, 20, 91, 20, 66.

Try to find a new representation such that its makespan is smaller than all of the above. The representation must satisfy the following conditions:
1. It must be different from all representations above. 
2. It must start with <rep> and end with </rep>. 
3. It must contain 50 numbers in total, with each job number appearing exactly 5 times.
Do not write code.
system: Here's a new representation that aims for a lower makespan:

user: Job number 1 appears 6 times in the representation.
system: I apologize, but I cannot generate a new representation that meets all the requirements. I am unable to control the makespan or ensure that a new representation is indeed better than the existing ones without having access to a scheduling algorithm to evaluate the representation. My previous attempts have also failed at strictly adhering to the problem's constraints.

user: Please try again.
system: I apologize for the errors in the previous attempts. It's proving challenging to generate a valid and improved representation while adhering to all the constraints. I will try again, focusing on diversification and avoiding direct repetition.

system: I apologize for the repeated errors.
