Conversation history: 
user: You are given 6 jobs and 6 machines. Each job consists of 6 operations that must be processed in a predefined sequence on designated machines with given processing times:
Job 0 follows the machine sequence 2 → 0 → 1 → 3 → 5 → 4 with processing times 1, 3, 6, 7, 3, 6.
Job 1 follows the machine sequence 1 → 2 → 4 → 5 → 0 → 3 with processing times 8, 5, 10, 10, 10, 4.
Job 2 follows the machine sequence 2 → 3 → 5 → 0 → 1 → 4 with processing times 5, 4, 8, 9, 1, 7.
Job 3 follows the machine sequence 1 → 0 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 with processing times 5, 5, 5, 3, 8, 9.
Job 4 follows the machine sequence 2 → 1 → 4 → 5 → 0 → 3 with processing times 9, 3, 5, 4, 3, 1.
Job 5 follows the machine sequence 1 → 3 → 5 → 0 → 4 → 2 with processing times 3, 3, 9, 10, 4, 1.
Below are some previous operation-based representations of schedules and their makespan values. The representations are arranged in descending order of makespan, where smaller values indicate better performance.

Try to find a new representation such that its makespan is smaller than all of the above. The representation must satisfy the following conditions:
1. It must be different from all representations above. 
2. It must start with <rep> and end with </rep>. 
3. It must contain 36 numbers in total, with each job number appearing exactly 6 times.
Do not write code.
